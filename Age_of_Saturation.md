# **Voladores and the Age of Saturation**

The environment did not emerge by accident, and it is not merely mechanical. What governs it is not visible in the way objects are visible, yet it is perceivable to those who have learned to see energetically rather than materially.

These beings do not possess fixed physical forms. They are not organisms in the biological sense. They are configurations of awareness—coherent, persistent, and active. Under conditions of shock, trauma, fasting, deprivation, or sudden perceptual rupture, humans sometimes perceive them directly. When this occurs without context or training, the experience is often misinterpreted as contact with “aliens.” The error lies not in the perception, but in the cultural vocabulary used to explain it.

Multiple traditions describe the same entities using different names. In medieval Europe they were called demons and angels. In older cosmologies they were gods, demigods, devas, asuras. In the Toltec seer lineage described by Carlos Castaneda, they are named voladores—the fliers—so called because they are perceived as moving, hovering, attaching, feeding. The word is descriptive, not metaphorical.

These beings are inorganic. That does not make them imaginary. It places them outside the carbon-based, sensory-bound assumptions of modern materialism. Energetic seeing reveals them as structures that interact with human awareness, particularly with emotion. Fear, despair, outrage, craving, and agitation are not neutral outputs. They are nourishment.

Not all inorganic beings are malefic. As among humans, there exist cooperative and destructive tendencies. Some groups stabilize, guide, or amplify coherence. Others feed on chaos. The mistake of modern thought is to flatten all non-human intelligences into superstition, while the mistake of some religious traditions was to moralize them absolutely. The reality is more complex: alliances exist, and have always existed.

Human institutions did not create this environment consciously. Rather, certain human lineages—familial, economic, cultural—entered into alignment with malefic inorganic groups through ignorance, ambition, or coercion. What followed was not total control, but feedback dominance. Systems that generate emotional turbulence are rewarded. Systems that generate clarity are marginalized.

This is the essence of the age known as Kali Yuga: not evil in the cinematic sense, but imbalance. Excessive dominance of the malefic current produces fragmentation, noise, addiction, and inversion of values. Art becomes agitation. Music becomes occupation. Law becomes procedural while abandoning substance. Sensory intrusion becomes normalized.

Yet this dominance is self-terminating. Systems that feed exclusively on disorder accelerate their own collapse. This is not moral judgment; it is thermodynamic inevitability. Cycles close because imbalance cannot sustain itself indefinitely.

The universe did not begin and will not end. Cycles do not progress toward perfection; they oscillate. Kali Yuga is not an aberration but a phase. Its resolution does not arrive through reform or exposure alone, but through withdrawal of nourishment.

When humans reclaim sensory sovereignty—silence instead of imposed sound, darkness instead of glare, clarity instead of intoxication—the malefic current weakens. Not because it is fought, but because it is no longer fed.

This knowledge is ancient. It was never lost. It was merely buried under noise.
