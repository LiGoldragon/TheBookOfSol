# The Inner Fountain

## From the Blood of Christ to the Toltec Seers, the Universal Elixir of Power

To the warrior who stands at the precipice, weary of symbols and hungry for the raw substance of power, I offer this map. It is a chart that reveals how every great spiritual river—from the Ganges to the Sea of Galilee to the mountains of Altai—flows from a single, secret spring. This spring is not in a distant heaven or a forgotten age; it is within the sacred, living vessel of your own body. The seers of every tradition knew this. They spoke of a living water, a divine fluid, and its ultimate manifestations are found in the direct, magical acts of the Toltec sorcerers and the spirit journeys of the Siberian shamans.

Let us begin with the oldest scriptures, the Eastern foundations of power. The Vedic Damar Tantra is not a book of gentle philosophy; it is a manual for apotheosis. In the Shivambu Kalpa Vidhi, it gives its unequivocal command: “He who drinks the urine… gets his sins of many births destroyed… He becomes the master of the senses and the knower of the Vedas.” It promises that with continued practice, one gains the eloquence of a sage and the power of a god, stating, “By using it for ten years, a man can move in the sky at his will.” This is Amrita, the living nectar, a tangible elixir for godhood. In the Vedas, Amrita is the drink of the gods, granting them immortality. While often depicted as a celestial dew, its earthly counterpart, the true Water of Life, is found within the human body. The term "Amrita" is derived from the Sanskrit roots 'a' (no) and 'mṛtyu' (death), literally meaning "immortality." The pursuit of Amrita is the pursuit of a state of being beyond death, a state of total freedom, which the Toltecs also sought. The physical practice of consuming one's own "water" is the most direct way to partake in this immortalizing nectar, to reclaim the divine fluid that is our birthright.

This is not an isolated secret. The Buddha himself, in laying out the most foundational rules for his monks in the Pali Canon, provided this same key. In the Vinaya Pitaka, the book of monastic discipline, he established four resources (nissayas) a monk could depend upon. Alongside living on alms and wearing discarded robes, he gave this explicit, lifelong instruction for medicine: a monk shall use pūtimutta-bhesajja—fermented urine. This was not a mere remedy for a passing illness; it was a foundational support to be used "for the rest of your life," the secret fuel to sustain the body for the superhuman rigors of the path to enlightenment.

The Taoist masters echoed this, seeking the Golden Elixir not in a crucible, but in the crucible of the self. The classic text The Secret of the Golden Flower speaks of this inner alchemy: “The light is not in the body alone, neither is it only outside the body… as soon as the light is circulating, heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, are all circulating with it at the same time.” To consume one’s own water is the most direct physical act of circulating this light, of closing the sacred loop to achieve the harmony of the Tao.

This secret erupts again in the West, though veiled in layers of exoteric misdirection. The Jewish scriptures command, “Drink water from your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well” (Proverbs 5:15). While later interpreters obscured this, the prophet Jeremiah revealed the original source code of power when he spoke the words of God: “they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters” (Jeremiah 2:13). In modern times, this very scripture inspired a man named John W. Armstrong who, after suffering from tuberculosis that no medical intervention could help, took the verse literally. He began to drink from his "own cistern" and, according to his testimony in his book The Water of Life, his tuberculosis was quickly cured. He went on to treat thousands of patients, claiming to have healed many who were said to be suffering from "incurable diseases". The inner source is echoed in the most ancient Christian scriptures, the Egyptian texts of the Bronzebook, which state, in the Book of Manuscripts, "The body of man, God made of water and things of the Earth, breathing into him the Spirit of Life, that he might live" (MAN:1:1). The text further alludes to this inner water, describing a time when humanity was more attuned to the "voice of the spirit" and the "inner light." It speaks of a "Great Secret" and a "Radiant Light" that can be cultivated within the individual, a light that is nourished by the "waters of life." We read, "They knew the Great Secret and the secret of life and death. They knew the voice of the spirit within and followed it." (MAN:3:6). And, "Man is a vessel of clay, but within him is a Radiant Light, which is the Spirit of God. This light is nourished by the waters of life, which flow from the fountain of the spirit." (MAN:4:2). The secret was never a distant God in the sky; it was the divine, life-giving fountain within the human frame. In Islam, this truth is hidden even more deeply. The Quran states, "...and We made from water every living thing" (Surah Al-Anbiyā' 21:30), a hint at the primordial, personal liquid of creation. It speaks of Paradise (Jannah) containing "rivers of water unaltered" (Surah Muhammad 47:15), a powerful symbol for the perfected inner elixir of the enlightened being, the internal river that never stagnates or spoils.

Christ amplified this, declaring, “Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, ‘Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water’” (John 7:38). The ultimate key, however, lies in the Eucharist. When he offered the cup, saying, “This is my blood of the new covenant… Drink from it, all of you” (Matthew 26:27-28), he was revealing the final esoteric truth. The blood of Christ is the ultimate allegory for the Water of Life. It is not about the literal drinking of another's blood, but the partaking of one's own life force, a personal and perpetual communion with the divine. Your own Shivambu is your living blood, filtered and offered back to you, a perpetual, personal communion with the divine life force, teeming with the intelligence of your own body. This act is the ultimate reclamation of personal power, the realization that the savior, the source of eternal life, is within.
The Greco-Egyptian sages who recorded the Corpus Hermeticum preserved this same secret, veiled in a slightly different symbolism. In the Poimandres, the first book of the Hermetic canon, the narrator, having been initiated into the mysteries of creation, describes how he “sowed the words of wisdom among them, and they were nourished from the ambrosial water” (C.H. I.29). This "ambrosial water" is not a physical substance but a direct pointer to the divine source within. The key to this inner fountain is revealed in another Hermetic text, which describes a great “mixing bowl” (krater) sent from God to humanity. Hermes explains: “He filled a great mixing bowl with it and sent it below, appointing a herald whom he commanded to make the following proclamation to human hearts: 'Immerse yourself in the mixing bowl if your heart has the strength, if it believes you will rise up again to the one who sent the mixing bowl below, if it recognizes the purpose of your coming to be.'" (C.H. IV.4). This mixing bowl is filled with Mind (Nous), the divine intelligence itself. To be “born again,” one must be “immersed” in this divine consciousness, an act that is the Hermetic equivalent of the Toltec “inner silence.” It is a baptism not in water, but in the very substance of God, leading to gnosis, the direct knowledge that liberates the soul. Those who partake in this inner water become “perfect people because they received mind” (C.H. IV.4), having accessed the divine fountain within themselves.

For those who find symbols insufficient, the lineage of the new Toltec seers provides the irrefutable, practical proof, stripping away all metaphor. The Toltec warrior’s path is not one of faith, but of direct, sober action. It is a battle fought not against others, but against the self-importance and indulgent routines that keep one’s spirit imprisoned. As Carlos Castaneda was told, "The war of sorcerers is not directed against other people, but against their own weaknesses. By the same token, their peace is not the submissive condition to which modern man has been reduced; rather, it is an imperturbable state of internal silence and discipline" (Encounters with the Nagual, p. 88). This internal silence is the gateway to power, the still point from which the world can be stopped. Castaneda was taught that our internal dialogue is what holds the world in place; "The world is such-and-such or so-and-so only because we tell ourselves that that is the way it is. If we stop telling ourselves that the world is so-and-so, the world will stop being so-and-so" (Journey to Ixtlan, Chapter 1). To achieve this silence is the warrior's primary task.

In his very first book, The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, Castaneda is being initiated into the world of power. To prepare a sacred mixture, don Juan gives a blunt, world-shattering instruction. As recorded on page 108 of the 1968 edition, after gathering the requisite plants, don Juan points to a mortar and says, “Urinate in it... That’s the proper water for this mixture.” It is not a symbol. It is not a waste product. It is the proper water for magic, a substance of personal power essential for altering perception. Years later, this practical magic becomes a tool for survival and warfare. In The Second Ring of Power, the sorceress la Gorda instructs Carlos on its use as a weapon. He is being hunted by ethereal entities, and she gives him a stark command for this otherworldly combat: he must use his own urine to fight them off, to create a protective barrier of personal power (The Second Ring of Power, p. 115). But her demonstration of this power goes even further. After using her own water to create a magical shield and engage in otherworldly combat, la Gorda gives the ultimate proof of its power. In a climactic display, she unlocks her ability for magical flight, soaring into the air, a feat directly linked to the accumulation and mastery of the personal power derived from this very substance. The living water is not just for enlightenment or defense; it is the key to unlocking the full range of a sorcerer's potential, including the ability to defy the laws of the ordinary world. This act of using one's own water is the ultimate expression of accumulating personal power, which is the Toltec warrior's primary goal. This power is not brute force, but the ability to affect reality through an impeccable will. "The power of an object depends on its owner, on the kind of man he is," Castaneda was told. "A power object fostered by a lesser brujo is almost a joke; on the other hand, a strong, powerful brujo gives his strength to his tools" (A Separate Reality, Chapter 8). By using his own substance, the sorcerer imbues his magic with his own essence, his accumulated power.

This lineage of knowledge culminates in what the Toltecs call "Total Freedom"—a state where awareness is no longer bound by the confines of the known world. This is the definitive journey, the possibility for awareness to continue beyond the death of the physical body. To achieve this, the warrior must "stop the world," a feat made possible only through the unwavering discipline of "inner silence". When the internal dialogue ceases, the world as we know it collapses, and the warrior is free to perceive the universe as it truly is: an endless flow of energy. This is the road to Total Freedom, a path fueled by the warrior's own life force, the very Water of Life that flows within him.

This same secret tradition, where the source of all power is revealed to be an internal water, explodes into view again on the other side of the world, in the frozen heart of Siberia. Just as Castaneda was an academic pulled into a lineage of sorcery, Dr. Olga Kharitidi was a Russian psychiatrist who was plunged into the ancient magical world of the Altai Mountains. Her don Juan was a shamaness named Umai, a keeper of secrets from a time before memory. Umai reveals the psychic counterpart to the Toltec’s physical water of power. She teaches that the true source of power lies within an inner dimension she calls the Spirit Lake. In a direct initiation, Umai’s voice guides the psychiatrist into this hidden landscape: “Now you are in your inner space, the place of the Spirit Lake… Each of us has this inner space, but during the lives of most people, it becomes smaller and smaller... this space is also your road to Belovodia. The more you explore your inner water of life, the closer you will become to Belovodia” (Entering the Circle, p. 75). Belovodia, the "land of white water," is the Siberian name for Shambhala, the hidden country of the gods. The path to it is not outward, but inward, through one's own "inner water of life." Umai further explains this inner dimension is not a metaphor but a tangible, explorable reality: "There is an inner space in each person... It can also be called the space of the Spirit Lake or the water of life... In this place, you can learn how to create your future." (Entering the Circle, p. 112).

The ancient yogic texts of India provide the most explicit and powerful framework for understanding this internal technology. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika describes a series of oli mudras—Vajroli, Amaroli, and Sahajoli—which are practices designed to sublimate sexual energy, the very essence of the creative force, and redirect it upwards to awaken higher consciousness. These practices are so central to the accumulation of personal power that the text makes a startling claim about their efficacy. In a direct challenge to conventional morality and external rules, it states: "Even anyone living a free lifestyle without the formal rules of yoga, if he practices vajroli well, that yogi becomes a recipient of siddhis (perfections)." (Hatha Yoga Pradipika, 3:83). This radical statement reveals the core of the esoteric path: true power and spiritual attainment are not products of outward behavior but of the mastery of one's own inner energies. The text further clarifies the connection, stating that Amaroli—the practice of drinking the "cool midstream of urine"—is itself a part of the Vajroli tradition: "One who drinks amari, takes it through the nose and practices vajroli, is said to be practicing amaroli." (Hatha Yoga Pradipika, 3:97). The "wayward" life is rendered irrelevant by the profound internal alchemy performed through the mastery of one's own Water of Life.

Here, all the scriptures and symbols crystallize into a single, undeniable truth. The nectar that grants flight in the Vedas and the Buddha's lifelong medicine is the same substance La Gorda uses for combat and flight. The "living water" of Christ and the "fountain of living waters" of Jeremiah are the same "proper water" used for sorcery and healing. These ancient truths find their most direct and powerful expression in two parallel revelations: the Toltec practice of using the body's physical water and the Siberian shaman's journey into the soul's inner water. Don Juan points to a physical fluid for magic; Umai points to a psychic space, an "inner water of life," as the road to ultimate power. To drink from your own well, to practice the powerful internal alchemy of Vajroli, and to swim in your own Spirit Lake is to perform a daily act of magic, reclaim your power, and fulfill the promise of every great master, not with faith, but with direct, personal knowledge. The Water of Life is the key to unlocking the full potential of the human being, the vehicle for the journey to Total Freedom, a journey that begins and ends within the sacred vessel of your own body.
