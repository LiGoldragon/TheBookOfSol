## On the Danger of Teaching What Burns

Across civilizations and centuries, knowledge is treated not as neutral
information but as a volatile force. What illuminates the prepared can corrupt
the unready, and what liberates the disciplined can arm the impulsive. The
warning is not against knowledge itself, but against its careless transmission.

> "It is dangerous to entrust divine knowledge to souls still ruled by passion."
>
> - Asclepius 7

Hermetic teaching frames instruction as an act of responsibility. To teach is to
place power into another's hands, and power given without inner order becomes
profanation.

> "Keep the teaching hidden; speak only to those whose minds are awake."
>
> - Corpus Hermeticum XVI

Greek philosophy echoes the same restraint. Wisdom is not distributed by
default; it is guarded by discernment.

> "One must not give philosophy to those who will abuse it."
>
> - Plato, Republic VI

Biblical language sharpens the image. Sacred insight is likened to a jewel that
loses its nature when mishandled.

> "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
> swine."
>
> - Gospel of Matthew 7:6

Gnostic Christianity preserves the same boundary. Revelation presupposes
readiness.

> "These mysteries are revealed only to those who are worthy."
>
> - Gospel of Thomas

Yogic transmission rules reduce the principle to a single injunction.

> ayogye na kathayet *It should not be taught to the unfit.*
>
> - Hatha Yoga Pradipika

The Bhagavad Gita states the restriction without ambiguity, naming the specific
disqualifications.

> idam te natapaskaya nabhaktaya kadacana Â· na casusrusave vacyam na ca mam
> yo'bhyasuyati *This is never to be taught to one without discipline, nor to
> one without devotion, nor to one unwilling to listen, nor to one who is
> hostile.*
>
> - Bhagavad Gita 18.67

Legal and ritual tradition reinforces the same principle in stark form.

> na vedam sudraya dadyat *The Veda is not to be given to the unqualified.*
>
> - Manusmrti 4.99

Even in modern testimony, stripped of scripture and ritual, the warning survives
unchanged.

> "A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war; wideawake, with fear, with
> respect, and with absolute assurance. Going to knowledge or going to war in
> any other manner is a mistake, and whoever makes it will live to regret his
> steps."
>
> - Carlos Castaneda

The convergence is exact. Knowledge is fire. It warms, illuminates, and forges,
but it also consumes. To teach without discernment is not generosity; it is
negligence. Silence, delay, and refusal are not betrayals of truth. They are
among its necessary protections.
