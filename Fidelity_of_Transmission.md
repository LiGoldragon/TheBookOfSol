## On Plasma Retention, Tyranny, and the Fidelity of Transmission

**Plasma retention**, known in the yogic tradition as **Śivāmbu** and systematized as **Amarolī**, was not a peripheral curiosity but a **central tenet** placed by the earliest sage-writers, who wrote as practitioners and not as spectators. Authority arose from **use**, not theory; from **embodied verification**, not speculation. Where health was sovereign, speech was **plain**.

A practice that ends dependency **dissolves tyranny at its root**. Tyranny governs through **scarcity**, **fear**, and **managed reliance**; autonomy removes its leverage. This dynamic explains the pattern of transmission. **Explicit, procedural texts**—brief enough for memory, daring enough to refuse allegory—force a simple choice upon editors: **preserve intact or destroy**. Where they survive, **accuracy survives with them**. The **Damar Tantra** stands here, preserved precisely because it could not be corrected without exposure.

**Comprehensive compendia** follow another fate. The **sheer length** of the **Caraka Saṃhitā** made censorship possible. Vastness invites pruning; compilation invites correction. In a corpus of such scale, **omission is invisible**, **substitution appears scholarly**, and **silence passes for refinement**. Tyranny need not burn what it can quietly edit. Thus the text endured by harmonizing with order, filtering what threatened autonomy. It preserved **medicine**; it shed **sovereignty**.

Within this very corpus the tension is visible. *Mūtra* is named **mala**, waste; yet **excessive urination is declared harmful and depleting**. What is dismissed as refuse is simultaneously guarded against loss. The contradiction betrays an underlying truth: **what the body cannot afford to lose is not inert**. Where recycling is unnamed, depletion is nonetheless feared. **The doctrine recoils while the physiology speaks.**

Later yogic writings—such as the **Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā**—reinforce this division. Issuing from **true yogic lineages** indifferent to throne, court, or creed, they preserved **what worked**, not what was acceptable. Their concern was **practice**, not propriety; **liberation**, not governance. Where they speak explicitly, they echo the earlier sages: **autonomy over dependency, method over permission**.

The earliest authors knew what later editors feared. They centered **plasma recycling** because it worked. Its **health supremacy** required no consensus, only practice. Truth persisted where it was stated **without veil** and compressed for **memory** when writing failed. **Accuracy followed explicitness; sovereignty survived where courage prevailed.**
