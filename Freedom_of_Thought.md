# Law, Liberty, and the Fiction of Intellectual Property

Law is not born of convenience, nor of envy, nor of the desire to shelter
weakness from competition. Law arises from nature itself, as the rational
ordering of defense against injury. Its function is singular and severe: to
protect freedom where it can be violated, and property where it can be taken.
Where no loss occurs, law has no subject. Where no injustice exists, coercion
has no warrant.

Property, properly understood, attaches only to scarce things. A field, a house,
a tool can be occupied by one will at a time; conflict is possible, and law
intervenes to prevent violence. Ideas do not share this character. They are not
diminished by use, not exhausted by sharing, not lost by being learned. To copy
is not to dispossess. To imitate is not to steal.

This distinction is not rhetorical; it is definitional. Confusion enters only
when terms are corrupted and metaphors are mistaken for realities.

Theft requires loss. Property requires scarcity. Law requires justice. Once
these terms are restored to their proper meanings, the edifice of “intellectual
property” collapses without resistance. No one loses an idea when another learns
it. No one is deprived of use when another copies. No injury occurs, and
therefore no injustice arises.

Yet to enforce so-called intellectual property, the state must reach beyond the
alleged idea and seize control of real, scarce things: presses, machines, paper,
computers, and human bodies. Punishment is imposed not for harm done, but for
peaceful use of one’s own materials. Law is thus inverted, transformed from
shield into weapon.

The ancient tradition is unambiguous on this point. Law severed from justice is
not law at all, regardless of how solemnly it is proclaimed or how forcefully it
is enforced.

Modern economic reasoning reaches the same conclusion by another path. Property
rules exist to manage scarcity and prevent conflict. Extending ownership to
non-scarce ideas manufactures artificial scarcity and creates conflict where
none existed, rewarding control over expression rather than productive labor.

The moral consequence is unavoidable. To protect the lazy inventor against the
industriousness of peers is not justice but favoritism. To force a publisher to
pay any author whom he has not voluntarily chosen to support is not protection
but extortion. Such acts require violence or its threat, and violence used
without injury is itself a crime.

Law, when it remains law, defends freedom and restrains force. When it is bent
to guarantee tribute, monopoly, or unearned reward, it abandons reason and
becomes domination. Statutes may endure; penalties may be imposed; prisons may
fill. But where justice is absent, law itself has already vanished.
