**How Ghee Restored My Vitality and Reduced Animal Harm**

### **The Descent into Ojas Deficiency**

From the beginning, my trust was placed almost entirely in **śivāmbu**, assuming its purity and refinement would safeguard my vitality. I relied on it as the central pillar holding my system together. Yet beneath that reliance, a steady erosion of **ojas** unfolded—an erosion I did not recognize until it had already weakened both body and mind.

A major source of this decline was the **overconsumption of heavy, tamasic substances**, especially the so-called “protein” foods that modern narratives frame as strengthening. They burdened digestion so heavily that **agni** was drained each day. Every meal stole more vitality than it provided. I ate more to compensate for the weakness, and the more I ate, the weaker I became. Digestion became a siphon, pulling energy downward instead of building anything stable.

To preserve what little ojas remained, I intensified my practice of **amarolī** with near-desperate resolve. Amarolī does refine and conserve, but it could not keep pace with the losses produced by constant digestive strain and the continual flushing of vitality out of the system. What śivāmbu restored, the diet depleted. The imbalance widened.

### **The Immediate Restoration Brought by Ghṛta**

When **ghṛta** returned to my nourishment, the shift was immediate and unmistakable. The deep, persistent ojas craving that had shaped my behavior softened as though it had finally been answered. Strength rose through the body not with heaviness, but with coherence and stability. My thoughts steadied. The nervous agitation dissolved. The flame of **agni**, long strained and burdened, finally burned clean and even.

Nothing else had done this.  
Not disciplined raw fruit.  
Not the so-called protein foods.  
Not the intensity of śivāmbu or amarolī.

Ghṛta revealed the missing structure my system had been seeking all along.

### **The Hidden Harm of My Former Diet**

With clarity restored, another truth came forward. The diet I believed harmless was sustained by **vast ecological destruction**. The enormous quantities of fruit, nuts, and cultivated plants I consumed—driven by depletion rather than true hunger—were drawn from monocropped fields, chemically treated orchards, and industrial systems that displace or kill countless animals with every harvest.

I once believed myself harmless because no animal product passed my lips. In reality, my diet inflicted more damage on living beings than even the use of a **small amount of industrially produced ghṛta** ever could.

The comparison is not delicate. It is overwhelming. Even without ideal conditions or ethical refinement, the total harm associated with moderate ghṛta use is dramatically smaller than the devastation embedded in the agricultural machinery required to sustain an ojas-starved, overeating diet.

### **The Reduction of Harm Through the Restoration of Ojas**

When **ojas** returned, the changes were immediate and profound.  
My appetite softened.  
My need for constant food diminished.  
My reliance on industrially grown fruit collapsed.

And perhaps most striking of all, **my craving for fruit dropped sharply**—not through restraint or discipline, but because the internal deficiency that generated the craving was no longer there. The body no longer demanded constant sweetness to soothe an empty core. Once the structure of ojas was restored, the frantic pull toward fruit simply faded.

As consumption decreased naturally, my impact on the earth decreased with it. The hidden harm embedded in my former diet loosened its hold. Ghṛta restored vitality inwardly, and through that restoration, it reduced harm outwardly. Where deficiency demands excess, wholeness requires little.

### **Why This Must Be Spoken Clearly**

The same patterns appear throughout raw fruitarian and strict vegan communities. Individuals flushed of ojas cling to theories while their bodies weaken. They rely heavily on **śivāmbu** and **amarolī** to remain functional, yet their diets continue to undermine them, draining agni and weakening the structure that nourishment requires. They believe they live harmlessly while depending on agricultural systems that devastate far more animal life than moderate ghṛta use ever would.

My experience reveals a different path—aligned with **sattva**, steadiness, clarity, and the refinement required for subtler nourishment. **Ghṛta** did not obstruct this path; it enabled it. It strengthened my amarolī practice, restored my ojas, stabilized my body, quieted my cravings, reduced my dependence on fruit, and lessened the harm my life imposed upon the world.

This is not speculation.  
It is lived truth, unfolding with the same unmistakable clarity that began the moment ghṛta returned to my life.
