# On Grains, Saṃyoga, and the Primacy of Preparation

Grains are routinely blamed for heaviness, eruptions, and reactivity; Āyurveda
assigns responsibility to **preparation, combination, and condition**. A grain
functions as a neutral substrate whose effect is formed by **saṃskāra**
(processing), **saṃyoga** (combination), **uṣṇatā–śītatā** (temperature),
**ārdra–rūkṣa** (moisture or dryness), **kāla** (timing), **deśa** and **guṇa**
(quality and provenance), and the preliminary act of **prakṣālana / śodhana**
(washing and cleansing). Grain grown in degraded soil, treated with modern
agrochemicals, or stored poorly differs materially from grain grown cleanly and
handled simply; washing with pure or nearly-pure water removes surface
impurities so cooking proceeds on a clean substrate. Washing is part of
saṃskāra.

When preparation introduces friction—dryness, sharpness, reheating, incompatible
accompaniments—the result is disturbance. When preparation unifies qualities,
the same grain becomes a reliable builder of the body. The classical expression
of this unified preparation is **vilepī**: grain cooked fresh with ample water
into a soft porridge, adjusted from more liquid to more solid according to
strength and season, then finished with **ghṛta**. This form minimizes friction,
supports rebuilding, and supplies stable nourishment.

**Vilepī** concentrates the rule into practice. Clean grain, well washed
(**prakṣālana**), freshly cooked with sufficient water, gently heated, and
finished with **ghṛta** presents unified **guṇa** that allow agni to work
evenly. A more liquid vilepī soothes weakened digestion and restores rasa; a
thicker vilepī grounds and sustains when strength permits. This preparation is
treated not as a compromise, but as the **gold standard** for taking grains and
supplying the stable material the body uses to rebuild itself.
