**When Agreement Ends**
*On social fracture, solitary alignment, and the cost of leaving the
common table*

### Habit as Membership

To step away from chloride salts in a culture where their use is
nearly universal is not merely a physiological decision but a
withdrawal from a shared grammar of belonging, because repetition
creates allegiance and allegiance defends itself socially. What
appears outwardly as a dietary refusal is experienced inwardly and
collectively as dissent.

Kṛṣṇa names the causal chain with precision, locating desire not in
chemistry but in proximity.

> **saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ kāmāt krodho ’bhijāyate**
> *From association arises desire; from desire arises agitation.*
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 2.62

The upstream force is association itself. The substance follows.

Carlos Castaneda describes the same mechanism in secular language,
calling the majority “the common man,” not as insult but as structural
description.

> *“The common man lives only by description, by what others tell him the world is like.”*
> — *The Fire From Within* (1984)

Habit survives because it is described, mirrored, and socially agreed
upon.

### Right Action Against the Many

The *Gītā* never promises ease when one acts in alignment against a
misaligned field. It insists on action without appeal to consensus.

> **niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ**
> *Perform the action that must be done; action is superior to inaction.*
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 3.8

Kṛṣṇa further dissolves imitation as virtue.

> **śreyān sva-dharmo viguṇaḥ para-dharmāt svanuṣṭhitāt**
> *One’s own path, even if imperfectly lived, is superior to the well-performed path of another.*
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 3.35

Castaneda states the same law without metaphysics.

> *“We either make ourselves miserable, or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.”*
> — *Journey to Ixtlan* (1972)

Strength requires divergence. Misery is simply shared.

### Disenchantment and Social Retaliation

The *Upaniṣads* describe the internal turn that precedes visible
separation, the moment when collective reward loses its authority.

> **parīkṣya lokān karmacitān brāhmaṇo nirvedam āyāt**
> *Having examined the worlds gained by action, the discerning one becomes disenchanted.*
> — *Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad* 1.2.12

This disenchantment triggers response. Withdrawal from agreement
destabilizes the group.

> *“Once you stop taking part in the world’s self-importance, the world turns against you.”*
> — *The Second Ring of Power* (1977)

What is defended is not health, but cohesion.

### Association as Bondage

Yogic and tantric traditions state openly what social custom hides:
proximity multiplies habit, and habit masquerades as destiny.

> **saṅgaḥ saṁsāra-hetuḥ**
> *Association itself is the cause of cyclical bondage.*

Kṛṣṇa names the sentinels guarding that bond.

> **trividhaṁ narakasyedaṁ dvāraṁ nāśanam ātmanaḥ
> kāmaḥ krodhas tathā lobhas tasmād etat trayaṁ tyajet**
> *Desire, anger, and grasping are the three gates leading to self-ruin; therefore one abandons these three.*
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 16.21

Castaneda frames the same refusal as non-participation rather than
confrontation.

> *“A warrior does not argue. To argue is to assume that the other person’s world is as real as one’s own.”*
> — *Tales of Power* (1974)

Disagreement preserves the shared premise. Withdrawal dissolves it.

### The Lonely Interval

Both yogic texts and modern recovery testimonies describe the same
intermediate phase: companions fade before new ones appear. Alcoholics
in recovery report that sobriety felt like abandoning friends rather
than abandoning alcohol, because the substance had fused with humor,
memory, and identity.

Kṛṣṇa describes the required posture without consolation.

> **tulyanindāstutir maunī santuṣṭo yena kenacit**
> *Unaffected by blame or praise, silent, content with whatever comes.*
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 12.19

Castaneda strips the moment further.

> *“The average man goes to any lengths to avoid silence, because in silence he is forced to face himself.”*
> — *Journey to Ixtlan* (1972)

Silence exposes the cost of belonging.

### The Aloneness of the Path

The traditions converge most sharply here: the path narrows by
necessity, not elitism.

> *“The path of knowledge is not meant for everyone. Most people are repelled by it, and that is as it should be.”*
> — *A Separate Reality* (1971)

Kṛṣṇa offers the metaphysical complement, reframing loss of companions
as re-alignment rather than rejection.

> **na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ ye bhajanti tu māṁ bhaktyā**
> *I hold none as enemy or favorite; those aligned in understanding naturally draw near.*
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 9.29

Castaneda names the same inevitability in stark terms.

> *“Freedom is solitude. Not because it rejects people, but because it cannot be shared.”*
> — *The Active Side of Infinity* (1998)

### Closing Synthesis

Leaving the chloridic table follows a geometry described across the
*Bhagavad Gītā*, the *Upaniṣads*, yogic insight, Castaneda’s
testimony, and modern recovery narratives: agreement gives way to
friction, friction gives way to solitude, and solitude stabilizes into
clarity. What is abandoned is not salt alone, but the social gravity
that once made it unquestionable.
