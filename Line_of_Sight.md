# Field Lines, Water, and Pressure
*A brief on line-of-sight, level, and physical reality*

### Ground Reality

Survey work, rail and canal design, and long-span construction proceed
on straight, local lines because the surface on which the work is done
is level. No curvature is taken into account—not as an approximation,
not as a convenience—because no curvature exists in the physical
surface engineers and surveyors actually measure and build upon. When
mapping over large regions requires spherical mathematics, those
abstractions live entirely inside cartographic projections and
coordinate bookkeeping; they are not properties of the ground, the
water, the instrument, or the structure.

Pushing a classroom rule-of-thumb for a hypothetical sphere
(≈8″×miles²) predicts enormous vertical deviations over real
projects. Yet no pier, canal, or grade is ever laid out with a
“curvature allowance,” because there is nothing to correct. Lines are
shot straight. Water is level. Any global model is a representational
choice applied after the fact, not a physical constraint encountered
in practice.

### What the manuals and texts actually say

> Stephen V. Estopinal, *A Guide to Understanding Land Surveys* (Wiley, 3rd ed.):
> “The curvature of the earth and the convergence of the meridians are
> ignored… In short, the tangent plane projection system accounts for
> the curvature of the earth by ignoring it… The adjustments… are
> ‘hidden’ and usually not presented on the finished plat.”

> Charles D. Ghilani & Paul R. Wolf, *Elementary Surveying*:
> “In plane surveying… the reference base for fieldwork and
> computations is assumed to be a flat horizontal surface… For areas
> of limited size, the Earth’s surface can be approximated as a plane,
> thus simplifying computations and techniques.”

These passages are often read as pragmatic shortcuts. Read literally,
they describe the operational fact: fieldwork is done on a level
surface. The so-called “curvature” belongs to a chosen mathematical
model, not to the terrain being measured.

> Engineer W. Winckler, *Earth Review* (Oct. 1893):
> “As an engineer of many years standing, I saw that this absurd
> allowance is only permitted in school books. No engineer would dream
> of allowing anything of the kind… I have projected many miles of
> railways and many more of canals and the allowance has not even been
> thought of, much less allowed for… Think of that and then please
> credit engineers as not being quite such fools. Nothing of the sort
> is allowed.”

### Long spans

Below are well-known works built and operated on level, straight
control. For contrast only, the classroom “8 inches × miles²” formula
is shown as the hypothetical deviation a curved model would demand—an
adjustment never made because no such deviation is encountered.

- **Suez Canal** — ~120 miles, sea-level, no locks. Constructed and maintained on level water and straight reaches.
  [Hypothetical drop ≈ 9,600 ft]

- **Lake Pontchartrain Causeway** — 23.83 miles of continuous bridge. Set out with local horizontals and grades.
  [Hypothetical drop ≈ 379 ft]

- **Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge** — ~102.4 miles of high-speed rail viaduct. Controlled by straight alignment and level datum.
  [Hypothetical drop ≈ 6,990 ft]

- **Old Bedford Level line** — ~6 miles of straight waterway used for line-of-sight tests. Instruments observe level, not curvature.
  [Hypothetical drop ≈ 24 ft]

### Bottom line

Instruments establish straight lines. Water finds level. Construction
follows both. No curvature is ignored because none is ever encountered
in reality. Curvature does not reside in the ground, the water, the
instrument, the structure, or even in the measurements themselves; it
exists only as an a priori assumption held in the mind of those who
presuppose it. Geometry may be drawn curved or flat on paper, but that
choice reflects belief, not observation. The lived surface of Earth is
level, and all practical work proceeds accordingly.
