# Field Lines, Water, and Pressure  
*A brief on line-of-sight, level, and practice versus theory*

**Executive summary**  
Survey work, rail and canal design, and long-span builds are done on local straight lines. For everyday engineering, the curvature of the earth and the convergence of meridians are explicitly ignored—by design—because at project scales the surface behaves flat to instrument tolerance. When spherical math is needed (mapping, wide-area control), it’s shoved into the projection and coordinate system, not into the field line or the builder’s tape.  

To make the tension concrete: if you push the classroom rule-of-thumb for a sphere (≈8″×miles² drop), you’d predict hundreds to thousands of feet of “bend” over the spans below. Yet nobody pours piers or digs canals with a stepwise “curvature allowance.” Lines are shot straight; any global modeling happens in the computations that wrap the map—not in the rodman’s sight picture.

**What the manuals and texts actually say**

> “The curvature of the earth and the convergence of the meridians are ignored… In short, the tangent plane projection system accounts for the curvature of the earth by ignoring it… The adjustments… are ‘hidden’ and usually not presented on the finished plat.”  

> Charles D. Ghilani & Paul R. Wolf, *Elementary Surveying*:  
> “In plane surveying… the reference base for fieldwork and computations is assumed to be a flat horizontal surface… For areas of limited size, the Earth’s surface can be approximated as a plane, thus simplifying computations and techniques.”  

> Engineer W. Winckler, *Earth Review* (Oct. 1893):  
> “As an engineer of many years standing, I saw that this absurd allowance is only permitted in school books. No engineer would dream of allowing anything of the kind. I have projected many miles of railways and many more of canals and the allowance has not even been thought of, much less allowed for. This allowance for curvature means this—that it is 8 inches for the first mile of a canal, and increasing at the ratio by the square of the distance in miles; thus a small navigable canal for boats, say 30 miles long, will have, by the above rule, an allowance for curvature of 600 feet. Think of that and then please credit engineers as not being quite such fools. Nothing of the sort is allowed.”

**Long spans**  
Here are well-known spans. For contrast, the classroom “8 inches × miles²” rule gives the supposed drop relative to a tangent line. These are not construction allowances; they show the size of the hypothetical curve that engineers never apply.  

- **Suez Canal** — ~120 miles, sea-level, no locks. Navigation is guided by straight reaches and dredging, not by curvature math.  
  [Drop ≈ 9,600 ft]  

- **Lake Pontchartrain Causeway** — 23.83 miles of continuous bridge. Built with local straights and grades; no curvature table in the plans.  
  [Drop ≈ 379 ft]  

- **Danyang–Kunshan Grand Bridge** — ~102.4 miles of high-speed rail viaduct. Controlled locally; no “arc” adjustments built into spans.  
  [Drop ≈ 6,990 ft]  

- **Old Bedford Level line** — ~6 miles of straight waterway used for line-of-sight tests. Instruments shoot a line, not a curve.  
  [Drop ≈ 24 ft]

**Bottom line**  
Instruments extend straight lines. Water holds level. Practice treats the job as flat while any globe modeling, when invoked, sits in coordinate software. If someone claims engineers build with curvature allowances, ask for the page in the spec set where that table lives—and then point them to the manuals.
