# The Insanity of Promoting Blood Loss as Health

Modern people live in a state of continuous poisoning through contaminated foods, chlorinated diets, stimulants, and dense substances that overload the inner fires. From this condition comes a strange fear: the fear of one’s own plasma. What the ancients regarded as living essence is now seen as something dangerous, not because the plasma is harmful, but because the inputs are. The confusion is not in the fluid; the confusion is in what enters the body.

## Vedic Testimony

*Damar Tantra* speaks without ambiguity:

“Shivāmbu … is capable of abolishing old age and various types of diseases and ailments.”  
“All diseases can be cured by the regular use of one’s own fluid.”

Here the self-born fluid is treated as **medicinal intelligence**—a substance that reflects the organism’s state, clarifies itself, and supports the refinement of ojas. Fear of one’s own plasma is simply fear of one’s own internal condition.

The *Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā* reinforces the ancient principle of conservation:

“Through Amarolī, Sahajolī, and Vajrolī, the yogin conserves and raises the vital essence.”

The tradition is unified: **refine, preserve, recycle**. There is no praise of depletion.

## The Modern Inversion

To oppose plasma retention is to assert that loss of refined essence makes a body stronger. But loss of plasma is simply **medical bleeding** under another name. Removing one’s own refined fluid—whether through deliberate bleeding or habitual discharge—is the same physiological act: the body is weakened by the removal of its own subtle work.

Arguing that losing plasma is healthy is equivalent to reviving the doctrine that bloodletting restores vitality. This belief has already been disproven through centuries of harm, yet it resurfaces in modern language that treats disposal of living plasma as self-care.

## The Coherent Ancient View

Essence is strength.  
Conservation is renewal.  
Waste is depletion.

Losing plasma as a “health strategy” is not wisdom; it is **the revival of medical bleeding disguised as hygiene**. The Vedic position is unwavering: living plasma is refined power, and its preservation supports clarity, stability, and regeneration.
