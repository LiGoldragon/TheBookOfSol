# **On Water, Minerals, and the Error of Micronutrition**

Residue is not life. Ash is not nourishment. What survives fire describes death,
not physiology.

What are called “minerals” are rocks: inert residues identified by combustion.
They are catalogued by burning living matter and then credited with sustaining
life. This is a category error. Combustion reveals what remains when life is
gone; it does not reveal what life recognizes, accepts, or uses.

No one mistakes a living companion for a corpse. No one seeks warmth,
recognition, or response from a cold body simply because it once lived. Origin
does not confer identity. Presence does. The same clarity applies to
nourishment.

Pure water is always superior to mineralized water. Mineral loading forces
filtration and expulsion because it presents itself as foreign residue. Water
unburdened by additions hydrates by absence, not by coercion. When water carries
rocks, the body treats it as something to be removed.

Coconut water restores when it does because it is a living plant plasma. It is
not the ash-table of “minerals” that matters. Reduce coconut water to ash and
nothing restorative remains. To drink the ashes would be absurd. Yet modern
dietetics reasons precisely this way—by fire, not by life.

**On the Mineral Myth**

The mineral myth arises from confusing what can be weighed after destruction
with what functions during life. What persists after incineration is countable;
what sustains vitality is not. From this confusion, nourishment is treated as if
life were an accounting problem—entries debited and credited on a ledger
compiled from ruins.

Classical medicine never made this mistake.

> *Āhāraḥ prāṇakaraḥ*\
> Nourishment is that which carries life.\
> — *Caraka Saṃhitā*

Life is the criterion, not residue. That which does not carry life cannot be its
support.

> *Dravyāṇāṁ guṇāḥ karma ca*\
> Substances are known by their qualities and actions.\
> — *Caraka Saṃhitā*

Rocks have qualities and actions, but not nourishing ones. Their action is
burden, filtration, expulsion.

**Micronutrition as an Accounting Fiction**

So-called “micronutrition” treats nourishment as bookkeeping: trace remnants
tallied, balanced, and optimized as though vitality obeyed ledgers derived from
ash. The living system is reduced to a warehouse, intake to inventory, health to
compliance with columns of figures.

But life is not administered. It is recognized.

The living system does not consult tables compiled from destruction. It responds
to coherence, familiarity, and living continuity.

Direct recognition has always been the standard.

> *Na hi jñānena sadṛśaṁ pavitram iha vidyate*\
> Nothing purifies like direct knowledge.\
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 4.38

**Plasma Recycling as Resolution**

Plasma recycling (*amarolī*) dissolves the entire confusion. It is not imported,
not reduced, not theorized. It is already recognized because it is already part
of the living continuum. No sourcing problems. No mineral mythology. No
electrolyte performance.

> *Yukta āhāra-vihārasya*\
> Stability is preserved through right intake and restraint.\
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 6.17

Conservation precedes restoration. Loss precedes collapse.

Pure water when water is needed. Living fluids when they exist. Ash belongs to
fire, not to nourishment.

Plasma returned to life remains sovereign.
