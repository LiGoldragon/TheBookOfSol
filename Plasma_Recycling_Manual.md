Plasma recycling manual (Amarolī)

I. Foundational view

Plasma is a living, responsive substance when removed from the body.  
It continues to purify itself, separating into clear plasma above and its own rejected mucus and waste below.  
Every drop is living liquid gold and is preserved for aging, refinement, or reduction.

Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā links Amarolī and Sahajolī with Vajrolī, the conservation and refinement of vital essence.  
Damar Tantra teaches fluid-based rejuvenation:  
“Shivāmbu … is capable of abolishing old age and various types of diseases and ailments.”  
“All diseases can be cured by the regular use of one’s own fluid.”

II. Collection

All plasma is valuable and kept.  
Collected in clean glass containers with airtight lids.  
Midstream collection is optional and mainly for advanced refinement; for aging, every drop is retained.

III. Aging

A. General principles

Aging is the central transformative process.  
Plasma is aged in an auspicious, intentional, clean place.  
Temperature should be moderate: not too cold, not too hot.  
Slight warmth accelerates aging and enhances vitality.

Solarization is excellent on its own.  
Sunlight imparts additional life force and keeps it warm in cool conditions.  
Lunarization enhances sediment formation and subtle refinement.

B. Breathing and shaking technique

Plasma remains alive indefinitely when sealed.  
Breathing is optional and used only to accelerate aging.

Technique:  
1. Open briefly to introduce fresh oxygen.  
2. Seal and shake gently to distribute oxygen.  
3. Reopen briefly to let it breathe out.  
4. Reseal.

This cycle speeds aging, but without it the plasma still ages naturally.

C. Primary aging phase

1. Duration: one to two lunations.  
2. Process: the plasma rejects internal waste and forms sediment; the clear layer becomes refined.  
3. Environment: auspicious location; optional solarization and lunarization.  
4. Breathing: optional; every few days or weekly.  
5. Shaking: periodic and gentle.

Damar Tantra:  
“That which flows from oneself, matured by time, cuts through accumulations as fire through wood.”

D. Siphoning phase

1. Purpose: separate clear plasma from sediment.  
2. Method: siphon the upper layer with a clean tube without disturbing sediment.  
3. After siphoning: continue aging in a clean vessel; remove sediment.  
4. Only sediment is discarded.

E. Optional filtration

Coffee filters or fine cloth may be used.  
Filtration works best after proper siphoning.  
Filtered aged plasma becomes the primary cleansing and extraction medium.

F. Secondary aging (strong aged plasma)

1. Duration: several weeks to months.  
2. Conditions: slight warmth preferred; solarization and lunarization optional.  
3. Schedule: shaking every one or two weeks; breathing optional every two to four weeks.  
4. Result: strong aged plasma for deep purification and advanced applications.

IV. Herbal extraction

Plasma extracts herbal principles extremely quickly.  
Extraction is normally 15 minutes to 1 hour.  
Leaving herbs longer than a few hours often over-extracts.

All herb solids must be removed after extraction.  
Even preservative herbs (moringa, chili) should not remain; once their life force is drawn out, the solids become inert residue and impurities.

A warming environment accelerates extraction but boiling is unnecessary.

Procedure:  
1. Add herb to aged plasma.  
2. Allow 15–60 minutes for extraction.  
3. Siphon or filter immediately.  
4. Remove all solids.  
5. Seal the extracted plasma.

This mirrors Damar Tantra’s rasāyana method of using one’s own fluid as a carrier of herbal potency.

V. Reduction (soft plasma)

Reduced plasma is produced by boiling filtered aged plasma to one-quarter volume.  
Use stainless steel or clay pots.  
Avoid Teflon, aluminum, reactive metals, and induction stoves.

If the plasma was not cleared well beforehand, remaining impurities create unpleasant odor.  
Properly cleared plasma produces a pure, solar, purifying aroma.

The fumes of cleared plasma are beneficial to breathe.  
They purify the space and may also be inhaled deliberately, including through a nebulizer.  
Breathing the vapor during reduction is a traditional enhancement.

After reduction, perform final filtration to remove expelled solids.

Reduced plasma becomes thick, oily, and soothing.  
Used for sealing, nourishing, healing, massage, and salves.

VI. Wound application

Aged plasma is the primary cleanser: irrigates, dissolves debris, disinfects.  
Before each new salve layer, aged plasma is applied again.

Reduced plasma is the healer: seals, soothes, supports regeneration.

Herbal salves may be made with:  
- Moringa leaf powder (regeneration)  
- Yerba santa powder (contraction and closure)

VII. Nasal, ocular, and auricular uses

Fresh plasma is ideal for delicate regions.  
Aged plasma, diluted if needed, clears mucus and obstruction.  
Eyes receive only minute drops.  
Warm reduced plasma may be used sparingly in ears.

Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā:  
“He who drinks the mid-stream, snuffs it, and practices Vajrolī, practices Amarolī.”

VIII. Enemas

Fresh, aged, or mixed plasma may be used.  
Aged plasma is strongest; fresh moderates it.  
Volumes begin at 2–3 ounces.  
Frequency ranges from occasional to multiple times daily.  
Reduced plasma enemas provide calming nourishment.

IX. Massage and skin application

Reduced plasma is used for massage, grounding, softening.  
Aged plasma is used for intensive purification of localized tissues.

X. Bathing and foot soaks

Aged plasma is added to baths or foot soaks to draw impurities and stimulate circulation.

XI. Household cleaning

Aged plasma cleans dishes, laundry, and surfaces.  
Spot cleaning uses pure aged plasma followed by water.  
Three to four ounces of strong aged plasma wash a medium laundry load in low-mineral water.  
Removes oils and grime, including from bicycle chains.  
Regular practitioners often cease needing soap.

XII. General cycle strategy

Fresh plasma for gentle maintenance.  
Aged plasma for purification and extraction.  
Strong aged plasma for advanced cleansing.  
Reduced plasma for sealing, healing, nourishment, and regeneration.

Every drop is preserved, refined, cycled, and reused as living liquid gold.
