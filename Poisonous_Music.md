# Sound Without Consent

Poisonous narcotic music differs from other narcotics in one decisive way: it
does not remain private. It enters shared space, occupies the air, imposes
rhythm on the nervous system, and recruits everyone within range into
participation. What intoxicates through sound operates collectively, not
individually, and its harm lies in this forced communion, where choice dissolves
and atmosphere becomes dosage.

Sound is not neutral vibration. It organizes attention, shapes mood, and
entrains bodies into patterns of tension or release. When degraded, repetitive,
and engineered for stimulation rather than coherence, it functions as an
environmental drug. Walls do not stop it. Consent does not precede it. Silence
is displaced, and with silence goes the possibility of inner orientation.

Ancient texts observed this long before amplification and mass broadcasting, not
as cultural nostalgia but as structural insight into how sound acts on
consciousness.

> **vācaṃ dadhre upāsate**\
> *They uphold the worlds through speech.*\
> — Ṛgveda 10.125.3

Sound is presented as a force that upholds order. When the same force is
inverted, disorder follows as a matter of structure, not morality.

> **catvāri vāk parimitā padāni**\
> *Speech moves on four levels; most hear only the lowest.*\
> — Ṛgveda 1.164.45

Intoxicating music traps awareness at the lowest level of sound, the purely
external, where repetition replaces meaning and stimulation replaces
understanding.

The danger intensifies when sound abolishes the interval in which discernment
forms. Intoxication does not begin with excess; it begins with continuity, when
stimulation never resolves back into stillness and attention is denied its
natural reset.

> **nādaḥ saṃhārakāraṇaṃ**\
> *Sound is a cause of dissolution.*\
> — Śiva Sūtra 1.13

Dissolution names loss of coherence rather than destruction. Sound that never
releases collapses inner structure by saturation, turning space itself into
stimulus and erasing the boundary between what is chosen and what is merely
endured.

Another text points to the inward axis that saturated sound displaces.

> **yad etad akṣaraṃ gārgī aviditvā asmāl lokāt praiti sa kṛpaṇaḥ**\
> *One who departs this world without knowing the imperishable wanders in
> lack.*\
> — Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.10

Wandering names dispersion of attention, a condition easily induced when sound
agitates without orienting.

Even ritual literature treats sound as operational rather than decorative.

> **duṣṭe mantre yajño na tiṣṭhati**\
> *When the chant is corrupted, the work collapses.*\
> — Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa

A corrupted chant fails collectively. No participant remains untouched.

The proposition stands on its own: music engineered to intoxicate through
repetition, volume, and compulsion acts as a public narcotic. Its toxicity lies
in enforced exposure, in the conversion of shared air into stimulus, and in the
erosion of silence, which is the last refuge of consent.
