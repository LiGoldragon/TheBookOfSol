# The False Idol of Wisdom

Albert Einstein’s haloed image as the patron saint of modern science—his face
adorning posters, coffee mugs, and school corridors—is built on illusion. In
*The Manufacture and Sale of Saint Einstein*, Christopher Jon Bjerknes argues
that the twentieth century did not mark a triumph of scientific reason at all,
but rather its sabotage. Einstein, far from advancing knowledge, helped replace
the experimental clarity of true science with a new priesthood of mathematical
mysticism. His rise marked the death of genuine inquiry and the birth of
pseudoscientific superstition dressed in equations.

## The Pseudoscientific Prophet

Bjerknes traces Einstein’s ascent to the 1919 solar-eclipse expedition—an event
now enshrined as the “proof” of relativity. In truth, the photographic evidence
was inconclusive. The tiny deflections of starlight were within the margin of
error, yet the press proclaimed the birth of a new genius. It was not discovery
that made Einstein famous but deliberate fabrication: a coordinated effort by
Eddington and others to announce that the universe itself had been rewritten.
Newspapers worldwide repeated the claim, and a man whose theories baffled even
experts was suddenly elevated to near-divine status.

This was no victory for science, but for spectacle. The event replaced the
language of precision with that of mystery. Instead of demonstrating how the
world worked, Einstein’s new “relativity” demanded that people abandon
understanding altogether and trust authority.

## The Eclipse of Science

Before the twentieth century, scientific inquiry meant testing, falsifying, and
refining ideas through experiment. Einstein’s approach inverted this. His
theories were insulated from disproof; if data contradicted him, the data were
dismissed. What he created was not physics but a metaphysical fog—a kind of
priestly incantation whose power lay in its obscurity.

Nikola Tesla, who represented the older experimental tradition, saw through it.
He called Einstein’s relativity “a mass of error and deceptive ideas,” a web of
mathematical garbles designed to astonish the masses. Tesla’s critique was not
jealousy—it was a defense of sanity in science. He insisted that true physics
deals with causes and effects in the observable world. Einstein’s abstractions,
by contrast, detached physics from reality and made complexity itself a mark of
virtue.

## The Character of the Idol

Bjerknes paints Einstein as not only scientifically hollow but ethically
corrupt. His career shows a pattern of appropriation and evasion: taking credit
for the work of Lorentz, Voigt, Gerber, and Hilbert, then fleeing from debate
when confronted. He cultivated an image of moral superiority while practicing
opportunism. When his claims met resistance in Germany, he deflected criticism
by invoking persecution, turning scientific disagreement into political theater.

This manipulation extended to his political life. Bjerknes describes Einstein as
a self-promoting Zionist who preached world government while advocating racial
separation—a contradiction masked by his saintly persona. The press, enthralled
by his supposed genius, refused to challenge the hypocrisy.

## The Ghostwritten Sage

Einstein’s “wisdom,” too, was largely manufactured. His most quoted lines—the
slogans on posters and social media—bear the polish of ghostwriters, not the
cadence of genuine thought. Journalists like Alexander Moszkowski edited his
casual remarks into philosophical epigrams. “Imagination is more important than
knowledge” and “God does not play dice” became totems of profundity, even though
the first is meaningless and the second misrepresented his own views. The result
was an artificial voice—a ventriloquized oracle for an age that mistook clever
phrasing for depth.

Bjerknes exposes how this machinery of mythmaking gave Einstein a monopoly on
“wisdom” that he never earned. His public persona—gentle, absent-minded,
transcendent—was sculpted to conceal a man who lacked both originality and
honesty.

## The Cult and Its Consequences

The Einstein cult marked the moment when modern science ceased to be about truth
and became about prestige. Universities, journals, and media outlets built their
authority on the illusion of Einsteinian genius. In doing so, they sanctified
incomprehensibility as the new ideal. The public, unable to follow the
mathematics, learned to equate confusion with enlightenment.

Einstein thus stands not as the pinnacle of scientific progress, but as the
symbol of its capture by ideology and mystique. The “relativity revolution” did
not liberate physics—it buried it beneath abstraction.

## Conclusion: The Idol Crumbles

When the myth is stripped away, Einstein appears less as a thinker than as a
mascot for an age that lost its bearings. His fame rests on errors he did not
correct, words he did not write, and ideals he did not live by. The legend of
the humble genius was a sales campaign, not a testament to intellect.

Bjerknes’ work leaves us with a sobering truth: the twentieth century did not
elevate science to new heights—it replaced it with a cult. Einstein was its high
priest, cloaked in equations that few understood and none could question. His
legacy is not wisdom but its counterfeit—a monument to how easily the world can
be dazzled by nonsense when it is spoken in the language of authority.

Einstein, the supposed sage, was never a light of reason. He was the shadow that
fell when science turned its back on reality—the false idol of wisdom.
