# The False Idol of Wisdom

Albert Einstein’s haloed image as the patron saint of modern science—his face adorning posters, coffee mugs, and school corridors—is built on illusion. In *The Manufacture and Sale of Saint Einstein*, Christopher Jon Bjerknes argues that the twentieth century did not mark a triumph of scientific reason at all, but rather its sabotage. Einstein, far from advancing knowledge, helped replace the experimental clarity of true science with a new priesthood of mathematical mysticism. His rise marked the death of genuine inquiry and the birth of pseudoscientific superstition dressed in equations.

## The Pseudoscientific Prophet

Bjerknes traces Einstein’s ascent to the 1919 solar-eclipse expedition—an event now enshrined as the “proof” of relativity. In truth, the photographic evidence was inconclusive. The tiny deflections of starlight were within the margin of error, yet the press proclaimed the birth of a new genius. It was not discovery that made Einstein famous but deliberate fabrication: a coordinated effort by Eddington and others to announce that the universe itself had been rewritten. Newspapers worldwide repeated the claim, and a man whose theories baffled even experts was suddenly elevated to near-divine status.

This was no victory for science, but for spectacle. The event replaced the language of precision with that of mystery. Instead of demonstrating how the world worked, Einstein’s new “relativity” demanded that people abandon understanding altogether and trust authority.

## The Eclipse of Science

Before the twentieth century, scientific inquiry meant testing, falsifying, and refining ideas through experiment. Einstein’s approach inverted this. His theories were insulated from disproof; if data contradicted him, the data were dismissed. What he created was not physics but a metaphysical fog—a kind of priestly incantation whose power lay in its obscurity.

Nikola Tesla, who represented the older experimental tradition, saw through it. He called Einstein’s relativity “a mass of error and deceptive ideas,” a web of mathematical garbles designed to astonish the masses. Tesla’s critique was not jealousy—it was a defense of sanity in science. He insisted that true physics deals with causes and effects in the observable world. Einstein’s abstractions, by contrast, detached physics from reality and made complexity itself a mark of virtue.

## The Character of the Idol

Bjerknes paints Einstein as not only scientifically hollow but ethically corrupt. His career shows a pattern of appropriation and evasion: taking credit for the work of Lorentz, Voigt, Gerber, and Hilbert, then fleeing from debate when confronted. He cultivated an image of moral superiority while practicing opportunism. When his claims met resistance in Germany, he deflected criticism by invoking persecution, turning scientific disagreement into political theater.

This manipulation extended to his political life. Bjerknes describes Einstein as a self-promoting Zionist who preached world government while advocating racial separation—a contradiction masked by his saintly persona. The press, enthralled by his supposed genius, refused to challenge the hypocrisy.

## The Ghostwritten Sage

Einstein’s “wisdom,” too, was largely manufactured. His most quoted lines—the slogans on posters and social media—bear the polish of ghostwriters, not the cadence of genuine thought. Journalists like Alexander Moszkowski edited his casual remarks into philosophical epigrams. “Imagination is more important than knowledge” and “God does not play dice” became totems of profundity, even though the first is meaningless and the second misrepresented his own views. The result was an artificial voice—a ventriloquized oracle for an age that mistook clever phrasing for depth.

Bjerknes exposes how this machinery of mythmaking gave Einstein a monopoly on “wisdom” that he never earned. His public persona—gentle, absent-minded, transcendent—was sculpted to conceal a man who lacked both originality and honesty.

## The Cult and Its Consequences

The Einstein cult marked the moment when modern science ceased to be about truth and became about prestige. Universities, journals, and media outlets built their authority on the illusion of Einsteinian genius. In doing so, they sanctified incomprehensibility as the new ideal. The public, unable to follow the mathematics, learned to equate confusion with enlightenment.

Einstein thus stands not as the pinnacle of scientific progress, but as the symbol of its capture by ideology and mystique. The “relativity revolution” did not liberate physics—it buried it beneath abstraction.

## Conclusion: The Idol Crumbles

When the myth is stripped away, Einstein appears less as a thinker than as a mascot for an age that lost its bearings. His fame rests on errors he did not correct, words he did not write, and ideals he did not live by. The legend of the humble genius was a sales campaign, not a testament to intellect.

Bjerknes’ work leaves us with a sobering truth: the twentieth century did not elevate science to new heights—it replaced it with a cult. Einstein was its high priest, cloaked in equations that few understood and none could question. His legacy is not wisdom but its counterfeit—a monument to how easily the world can be dazzled by nonsense when it is spoken in the language of authority.

Einstein, the supposed sage, was never a light of reason. He was the shadow that fell when science turned its back on reality—the false idol of wisdom.
