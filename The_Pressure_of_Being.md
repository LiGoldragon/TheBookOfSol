# The Pressure of Being  
### A Cross-Traditional Anthology

---

## **Bhagavad Gītā**  
> *“He is a yogi who delights in the Self, who is satisfied in the Self, and who is steady in the Self alone.”* (6.21)  

---

## **Rig Veda**  
> *“May we with our own vital force be sustained; may the flowing streams of life uphold us.”* (RV 10.90)  

---

## **Mahābhārata**  
> *“When the mind is restrained and the senses are controlled, the Self remains steady, like a flame in a windless place.”* (Bhīṣma Parva)  

---

## **Gospel of Thomas**  
> *“If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.”* (Logion 70)  

---

## **Kolbrin Bible**  
> *“The strength of man is not in what he scatters, but in what he keeps within. For the inward fire, if guarded, sustains; if wasted, consumes him.”*  

---

## **Tao Te Ching**  
> *“He who knows how to stop does not exhaust. He who preserves himself endures.”* (Ch. 44)  

> *“The valley spirit never dies; it is called the mysterious female. The door of the mysterious female is the root of heaven and earth.”* (Ch. 6)

## **Carlos Castaneda / Don Juan**  

> *“Impeccability is nothing else but the proper use of energy. I’ve saved energy and that makes me impeccable.”*  

> *“Sorcerers say that in order to command the spirit, and by that they mean to command the movement of the assemblage point, one needs energy. The only thing that stores energy for us is our impeccability.”*  

> *“All that is required is impeccability, energy, and that begins with a single act that has to be deliberate, precise, and sustained. If that act is repeated long enough, one acquires a sense of unbending intent, which can be applied to anything else.”*  

> *“A sorcerer lives an impeccable life, and that seems to beckon the solution. Why? No one knows. Impeccability is simply the best use of our energy level.”*
