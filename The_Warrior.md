A warrior, a man of knowledge, lives a life of profound discipline and awareness, guided by a set of principles that distinguish him from the ordinary person. His existence is a constant striving for perfection, not for personal gain, but for the sake of the journey itself. Herein lies a cohesive guide to the life of a warrior, as gleaned from the teachings of Don Juan Matus and his tradition.

## The Path of the Warrior

To embark on the path of a warrior is to engage in a revolution against one's own ingrained habits and self-importance. It is not a path for the timid or the self-indulgent, but for those with a genuine interest and "guts of steel". A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war: "wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance". This path is not one of social obligation but of responsibility to oneself. The warrior's life is an endless challenge, and he takes everything as such, unlike the ordinary man who sees life's events as either blessings or curses.

A warrior understands that he is only a man, and his only regret is the brevity of life which prevents him from embracing all he would like to. He acknowledges his pain but does not indulge in it; instead, he finds joy in accepting his fate and assessing what lies ahead. His joy comes from accepting his fate and from the love he has for the world, which he considers his beloved. This love for the earth is what gives a warrior freedom and releases him from sadness.

The Four Natural Enemies of a Man of Knowledge
On his path, a man of knowledge must confront and overcome four natural enemies: fear, clarity, power, and old age.

 * Fear: The first enemy is fear. A man must not flee from it but defy it, taking the next steps in learning despite his terror. He must be fully afraid, yet he must not stop. Eventually, fear will retreat, and he will gain self-confidence.

 * Clarity: Once fear is vanquished, it is replaced by clarity of mind, which can be a blinding force. Clarity may give a man the false assurance that he can do anything he pleases. He must defy this clarity, using it only to "see" and waiting patiently before taking new steps. He must recognize that his clarity is but a point before his eyes.

 * Power: After overcoming clarity, a man of knowledge will encounter power, the strongest of all enemies. It is easy to give in to power, to become a master who makes rules. A warrior must defy this power, realizing it is never truly his. He must handle it with care and faithfulness, understanding that power without self-control is a mistake.

 * Old Age: The final enemy is old age, which cannot be completely defeated but can be fought off. If a man gives in to the desire to rest and forget, he will lose his last round. But if he lives his fate through, sloughing off his tiredness, he can be called a man of knowledge, even if only for a brief moment.

## The Warrior's Mood and Impeccability

The hardest thing in the world is to assume the mood of a warrior. It is a state of control and abandon, a state of continuous struggle, not for the sake of winning or losing, but for the struggle itself. "Every struggle is a warrior's last battle on earth," and in this battle, he lets his spirit flow free and clear, laughing in the face of his impeccable will.

A warrior's impeccability lies in the proper use of his energy. He saves his energy, and that makes him impeccable. He lives his life strategically, making his decisions so carefully that nothing can surprise him or drain his power. He is always ready, for he knows that "to be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives".

## The Importance of Death

A warrior thinks of his death when things become unclear. The idea of death is what tempers his spirit. He knows that death is his eternal companion, always to his left, at an arm's length, and this awareness makes him detached and free from the trivialities of self-importance. Death is the only wise adviser a warrior has. When he feels that everything is going wrong, he can turn to his death and ask if it is so. His death will tell him that he is wrong, that nothing really matters outside its touch.

A warrior gives his last battle on earth its due respect, knowing that his last act should be the best of himself. He accepts his destiny, knowing that in a world where death is the hunter, there is no time for regrets or doubts, only for decisions. Every warrior has a place to die, a place of his predilection where he has witnessed marvels and stored his personal power. There, he dances to his death, recounting the toil of his life.

## Techniques for a Warrior's Life

A warrior's life is a constant practice of techniques that help him to disrupt his routines, lose his self-importance, and become free and fluid.

 * Erasing Personal History and Losing Self-Importance: A warrior doesn't have a personal history. He has dropped it because it is no longer necessary for him. Self-importance is a man's greatest enemy; it weakens him by making him feel offended by the deeds of his fellow men. A warrior learns to laugh at himself and never takes himself seriously. He knows that his life is an endless challenge, and challenges are simply challenges, neither good nor bad.

 * Assuming Responsibility: A warrior takes responsibility for his acts, for the most trivial of his acts. He knows that he is in a weird world and must assume responsibility for being there. He understands that his acts are useless, yet he proceeds as if he didn't know it. This is a sorcerer's "controlled folly".

 * The Gait of Power and Not-Doing: The "gait of power" is a special way of running at night that allows a warrior to move with freedom and trust in his personal power, which merges with the power of the night. "Not-doing" is the technique of stopping the world, of seeing things as they are, not as we have been told they are. "Seeing" is attained only when one has stopped the world through the technique of "not-doing".

 * Dreaming and Stalking: "Dreaming" is a practical aid devised by sorcerers, a way of using the "nagual" by training the "tonal" to let go for a moment. A warrior seeks power, and one of the avenues to power is "dreaming". "Stalking" is the art of using behavior in novel ways for specific purposes. A warrior stalks himself ruthlessly, cunningly, patiently, and sweetly. The first principle of stalking is that a warrior chooses his battleground and never goes into battle without knowing the surroundings.

## The Nature of the World for a Sorcerer

For a sorcerer, the world is a mystery. He treats the world as an endless mystery and what people do as an endless folly. He knows that the world is such-and-such only because we tell ourselves that it is. A warrior is aware of this and strives to stop his internal talk. When the internal dialogue stops, the world collapses, and extraordinary facets of ourselves surface.

A warrior learns that his perception of the world can be changed and that there are other levels of reality. He learns to see things for what they really are, not just to look at their surface. Through "seeing," a man of knowledge becomes everything by becoming nothing; he vanishes and yet he's there.

The life of a warrior is a journey of return, a journey to the spirit. It is a path of impeccability and awareness, a path where every act is a warrior's last battle on earth. It is a life of freedom, joy, and abandon in the face of any odds.
