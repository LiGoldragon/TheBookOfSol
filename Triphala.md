# Triphalā — The Three

Triphalā stands as a quiet covenant between motion, restraint, and renewal, a
triune coherence in which Harītakī (that-which-carries-away), Bibhitakī
(that-which-keeps-away), and Āmalakī (the-nourishing-sour) do not compete but
correct one another, so that cleansing does not exhaust, nourishment does not
congest, and stability does not harden into inertia.

> **harītakī bibhitakī āmalakī iti triphalā**\
> Harītakī, Bibhitakī, and Āmalakī—\
> together forming a single, ordered whole.\
> — *Bhāvaprakāśa*

In this union, doṣa (tendency, imbalance-principle) is not fought but
re-educated, returning vāta (movement-principle), pitta
(transformative-principle), and kapha (cohesive-principle) to proportion, so the
body resumes its own intelligence rather than obeying an imposed force.

> **triphalaṃ rasāyanam**\
> Triphalā moves along the path of essence,\
> sustaining continuity without excess.\
> — *Caraka Saṃhitā*

As rasāyana (rasa = essence-flow, āyana = course), it does not promise escape
from time, but teaches endurance within time, preserving ojas (integrative
vitality) by refusing both depletion and hoarding.

> **cakṣuṣyaṃ triphalā śreṣṭhā**\
> Triphalā is foremost in restoring clarity of seeing.\
> — *Suśruta Saṃhitā*
