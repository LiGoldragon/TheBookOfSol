# True Āyurveda

## Discernment before Doctrine

Āyurveda is not a lifestyle brand, a supplement stack, or a botanical maximalism
dressed in Sanskrit; it is a method of seeing, grounded in effects, where
authority resides in what sustains life when observed over time rather than in
what circulates socially at speed. Its own classical definition dissolves
inherited authority by placing truth in discrimination between benefit and harm
as they appear in lived consequence, a move that quietly invalidates any
practice that overwhelms the organism with signals, substances, or constant
intervention under the banner of “holism.”

To understand true Āyurveda also means to understand where it has been
interrupted. The medical corpus did not descend through history untouched. The
**Caraka Saṃhitā**, the **Suśruta Saṃhitā**, and related works passed through
periods of censorship, political threat, cultural collapse, and textual
compression. These pressures left marks: abrupt shifts of tone, uneven treatment
of loss and conservation, warnings without completion. Taken soberly, these
lacunae make it obvious that certain practices—especially Śivāmbu and its yogic
form, Amarolī—were removed or softened. True Āyurveda therefore cannot mean
blind adherence to surviving text alone; it must take the texts at their own
first premise, which is verification by experience. When experience is allowed
to speak, Amarolī reasserts itself with such force that its exclusion becomes
untenable.

The core medical canon already prepares the ground. The *Caraka Saṃhitā* defines
Āyurveda as knowledge of what is *hitā* and *ahitā*, *sukha* and *duḥkha*,
*āyuṣya* and *anāyuṣya*—benefit and harm, ease and suffering, life-sustaining
and life-destroying—placing discernment before prescription and experience
before accumulation. The *Suśruta Saṃhitā* and the **Aṣṭāṅga Hṛdaya** operate
within the same discipline: they emphasize timing, measure, indication, and
withdrawal as much as administration, and they treat medicines as corrective
acts, not as daily dietary furniture. What they repeatedly warn
against—excessive loss, depletion through over-function, weakening through
uncontrolled flow—points directly to what must be conserved, even when not
named.

From this vantage, much of what passes today as “Āyurvedic healing” reveals
itself as a category error. The simultaneous ingestion of many herbs sends
conflicting signals at once, obscuring feedback and defeating discrimination.
Daily, indefinite dosing converts medicine into noise and erodes the organism’s
capacity to respond. The encouragement to eat large quantities of fruits and
vegetables as staples mistakes purgative and corrective agents for food,
collapsing therapy into diet and turning what should be temporary and targeted
into chronic stimulation. Classical Āyurveda repeatedly warns that excess—even
of what is nominally beneficial—produces depletion, because life is sustained by
circulation and conservation, not by constant flushing.

True Āyurveda therefore begins with subtraction. It asks what can be removed so
that signals become legible, appetite becomes truthful, and strength returns
without stimulation. It privileges single-substance trials over mixtures,
seasonal and situational use over daily routine, and foods that stabilize and
build over those that incessantly provoke elimination. This is why ghṛta
occupies a central place as a stabilizing, integrating medium, and why the texts
caution against habitual loss—through over-purging, over-urination, or chronic
laxation—because refined substances are finite and must be conserved and
intelligently recycled if life is to lengthen rather than flicker.

At this point the reintroduction becomes unavoidable. What the medical texts
imply through warning, yoga states as method. The **Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā** names
Amarolī explicitly and without embarrassment, preserving in practice what
medicine could not always preserve in prose. Amarolī is not an innovation added
to Āyurveda; it is the completion of its logic. Where censorship and catastrophe
forced omission, yoga carried the act. Where medicine guarded principles, yoga
closed the circuit. Experience of Amarolī is not subtle or ambiguous; its
effects are immediate enough to satisfy the very criterion by which Āyurveda
defines truth.

To study Āyurveda as it is, rather than as it trends, therefore requires two
movements at once: consulting the right texts and reading them historically. The
*Caraka Saṃhitā* for discrimination and the mechanics of depletion; the *Suśruta
Saṃhitā* for restraint, timing, and limits; the *Aṣṭāṅga Hṛdaya* for synthesis
without inflation; and the *Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā* for the practices that
complete what medicine sketches. Secondary manuals are useful only insofar as
they respect this economy of action, withdrawal, and conservation.

False Āyurveda multiplies inputs and calls the confusion vitality. True Āyurveda
reduces, observes, conserves, and completes the circuit that history tried to
break. It treats medicine as a scalpel, not a buffet, and it restores Amarolī
not as provocation but as necessity. When this discipline is restored,
persuasion is unnecessary. The effects authorize it.
