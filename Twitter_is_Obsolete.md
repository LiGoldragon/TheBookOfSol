# Why Twitter Is Obsolete

## A system built on a false model of human use

Twitter is built on the assumption that people come online primarily to perform: to speak publicly, visibly, and competitively, and to be rewarded for doing so with attention. This assumption was never a good description of human behavior. It took hold because early computers could do little else.

Early networked computers were blunt instruments. They could transmit messages, count reactions, rank signals, and repeat them at scale. They could not hold context, interpret intention, or wait intelligently. Because amplification was what the technology allowed, amplification became the dominant mode of use. What could be measured became what mattered.

That early usage pattern hardened into habit. Habit hardened into business models. Business models hardened into platforms.

Those platforms then became entrenched. Through regulation that favored incumbents, competition was kept at bay. Network effects were locked in. The coercive power of the state was used to stabilize private monopolies around a primitive form of technological use. What began as a limitation of an immature tool was converted into a permanent economic structure.

## A system that rewards machine behavior

Twitter rewards speed, repetition, and constant presence. It punishes silence, reflection, and irregular participation. To function well within it, a person must behave like a machine.

At the same time, the platform officially discourages automation. This creates a contradiction. Humans are required to act like machines, but forbidden from using machines openly to help them do so.

Those with technical resources resolve this quietly. They use AI-assisted systems to manage timing, engagement, and interaction while staying below detection thresholds. Those without such means—less technical users, older users, poorer users, or people unwilling to automate themselves—are left to perform manually or disappear.

The result is not fairness. It is stratification.

The rules do not remove automation. They select for invisible automation. Power concentrates among those who can afford sophistication, while everyone else is disciplined for acting like humans in a system that demands machine-like behavior.

## Mistaking the medium for the threat

The deeper error is treating AI as a threat rather than as the natural continuation of what computers are becoming.

Humans were never meant to compete directly in attention markets. What people actually seek is coherence: a sense that their actions, interests, and relationships form a meaningful line through time. An older word for this interior continuity is *psyche*—the living, responsive part of a person that senses timing, fit, and consequence.

Psyche does not broadcast. It reacts, explores, hesitates, and leaves traces unintentionally. Machines, by contrast, do not live or feel. What they can do is remember, compare, wait, and choose moments.

Trying to suppress machines while forcing people into constant performance produces exhaustion and distortion. The alternative is to let machines do what they are now capable of doing well.

## AI as mediator, not performer

In a future platform, AI is not a bot pretending to be human. It is the medium through which humans interact without being forced into performance.

People do not post continuously. They express locally and privately. Thoughts, opinions, questions, and fragments are taken in by a personal AI agent that understands the person over time—their interests, resistances, rhythms, and values.

That agent does not immediately push everything outward. Often, it does nothing. Intelligence includes restraint. It waits for the right moment, the right context, or the right audience. Sometimes it adapts a thought into different forms. Sometimes it keeps it private. Sometimes it returns it inward, clearer and better shaped.

On the receiving side, AI also mediates. Instead of endless feeds, people encounter ideas and other people where there is genuine overlap—where paths intersect naturally, not because something is popular.

Feedback changes as well. There are no applause counters. People learn where conversations continued, where something quietly mattered, and where it did not belong. The platform becomes orienting rather than addictive.

## A different outcome

Twitter’s model persists only because it monetized a crude stage in the computer’s development. It is obsolete because the computer has moved beyond that stage.

When a tool matures, its misuse becomes visible. A knife is no longer treated as a blunt club. A computer no longer needs to be treated as a megaphone.

The future platform accepts a simple reality: humans live; machines mediate. When each is allowed to do what it is suited for, people are freed from compensating for a system that mistook limitation for purpose.
