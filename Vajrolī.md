# Vajrolī: Sovereignty Made Innate

## Knowledge Before Restraint

Vajrolī names the moment when mastery ceases to be an effort and becomes
structure, when life-force is no longer defended against loss but organized so
thoroughly that loss no longer presents itself as a problem. What appears first
as deliberate regulation matures into inward certainty, and discipline sheds its
visible scaffolding.

> svecchayā vartamāno'pi yogoktair niyamair vinā / vajrolīṃ yo vijānāti sa yogī
> siddhi-bhājanam\
> *Even one who lives by personal inclination, without the customary yogic
> restraints—whoever truly knows Vajrolī becomes a vessel of accomplishment.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.83)

Vajrolī is declared as knowledge rather than prohibition. Its authority does not
arise from denial but from understanding that has reorganized impulse at its
root.

## The Conditions That Permit Mastery

The practice presupposes conditions already tuned toward steadiness. Nourishment
must calm rather than excite, and relationship must cohere with regulation
rather than scatter it.

> tatra vastu-dvayaṃ vakṣye durlabhaṃ yasya kasyacit / kṣīraṃ caikaṃ dvitīyaṃ tu
> nārī ca vaśa-vartinī\
> *Here two concrete requisites are declared, seldom available to just anyone:
> refined, stabilizing nourishment; and a partner whose conduct moves in
> alignment with disciplined governance.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.84)

These are not ideals but prerequisites. Without them, Vajrolī remains mechanical
or incomplete.

## Reversal, Not Repression

Here the body learns obedience to awareness. What once moved downward without
consent is trained to respond.

> mehanena śanaiḥ samyag ūrdhvākuñcanam abhyaset / puruṣo'py athavā nārī
> vajrolī-siddhim āpnuyāt\
> *By gradual and correct upward contraction, practiced carefully, whether man
> or woman may attain accomplishment in Vajrolī.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.85)

Loss is neither condemned nor indulged. It is reversed.

> nārī-bhage padad-bindum abhyāsenordhvam āharet / calitaṃ ca nijaṃ bindum
> ūrdhvam ākṛṣya rakṣayet\
> *Through practice one draws upward the fallen essence from the partner’s
> field, and one also draws up and preserves one’s own essence once it has
> moved.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.87)

## Direction as Destiny

Life and death are described as directions, not judgments.

> evaṃ saṃrakṣayed binduṃ jayati yogavit / maraṇaṃ bindu-pātena jīvanaṃ
> bindu-dhāraṇāt\
> *Thus preserving essence, the knower of yoga prevails: death follows its fall,
> life follows its retention.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.88)

Stability announces itself as clarity, as a body no longer leaking vitality into
time.

> sugandho yogino dehe jāyate bindu-dhāraṇāt / yāvad binduḥ sthiro dehe tāvat
> kāla-bhayaṃ kutaḥ\
> *From the holding of essence, fragrance arises in the yogin’s body; while
> essence remains steady, from where would fear of time arise?*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.89)

Physiology and awareness are bound into a single discipline.

> cittāyattaṃ nṝṇāṃ śukraṃ śukrāyattaṃ ca jīvitam / tasmāc chukraṃ manaś caiva
> rakṣaṇīyaṃ prayatnataḥ\
> *Essence depends on the mind, and life depends on essence; therefore both mind
> and essence are to be guarded with care.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.90)

## Sahajolī: When Effort Falls Away

At maturity, Vajrolī ceases to feel like a technique. Its movement becomes
continuous, and the text gives that continuity a name.

> sahajolir iyaṃ proktā śraddheyā yogibhiḥ sadā / ayaṃ śubha-karo yogo
> bhoga-yukto’pi muktidaḥ\
> *This is called Sahajolī, always to be trusted by yogins; this yoga brings
> auspiciousness and grants liberation even when joined with enjoyment.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.94)

Sahajolī does not oppose enjoyment, nor does it excuse excess. It names the
condition in which enjoyment no longer causes dispersal because regulation has
become innate.

## One Principle, Three Expressions

Vajrolī unfolds as a triad without division of essence.

> sahajolīś cāmarolir vajrolyā bheda ekataḥ\
> *Sahajolī and Amarolī are, in essence, differentiations arising from the
> single principle of Vajrolī.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.92)

Vajrolī governs. Sahajolī eases that governance into nature. Amarolī completes
the circuit by returning what is refined so nothing essential is wasted.

> amarīṃ yaḥ piben nityaṃ nasyaṃ kurvan dine dine / vajrolīm abhyaset samyak
> sāmarolīti kathyate\
> *One who regularly partakes of amarī, applies it nasally day by day, and
> practices Vajrolī correctly is said to embody Sāmarolī.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.97)

## Unification and Completion

What was first conserved is reintegrated. What was divided is made one.

> sa bindus tad rajaś caiva ekībhūya svadehagau / vajroly-abhyāsa-yogena
> sarva-siddhiṃ prayacchataḥ\
> *That essence and that generative force, unified within one’s own body through
> the yoga of Vajrolī practice, bestow all accomplishment.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.101)

The culmination is not denial of life but its transfiguration.

> deha-siddhiṃ ca labhate vajroly-abhyāsa-yogataḥ / ayaṃ puṇya-karo yogo bhoge
> bhukte’pi muktidaḥ\
> *Through the yoga of Vajrolī practice one attains bodily perfection; this yoga
> brings merit and grants liberation even amid enjoyment.*\
> (Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā 3.103)

Vajrolī completes itself where effort dissolves into nature, where Sahajolī
names the ease that follows mastery, and where life no longer spends itself
downward but circulates upward—complete, assured, and whole.
