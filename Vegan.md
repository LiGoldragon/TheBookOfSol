# Vegan, Reclaimed: Exclusively Vegetal — and Why Sodium Chloride Is Not Food

# Vegan, Reclaimed: Exclusively Vegetal and Salt-Free

## 1. Words Remember Their Roots

Language is not static. Words wander, bend, and are borrowed for fashions and causes, but they often drift back toward their natural, etymological meanings.

- **Radical** ← Latin *radix* (“root”): once “extremist,” now again “root-level change.”
- **Authentic** ← Greek *authentēs* (“self-authority”): from “official document” back to “true to one’s own self.”
- **Passion** ← Latin *passio* (“suffering/enduring”): from fluffy romance to a consuming life-drive.
- **Energy** ← Aristotle’s *energeia* (“being-in-act”): beyond physics back to vital actuality.
- **Vibe** ← “vibration”: from lab term to lived resonance.

**Vegan** belongs in this lineage. Coined in 1944 as “without animal products,” it need not be frozen there. Its natural destiny points to **vegetal**.

## 2. The Natural Meaning of Vegan

- **Vegan (diet):** *exclusively vegetal* — plant tissues, plant waters, or cultured plant cells (with fungi/algae included for practical labeling).
- **Vegetarian (diet):** *primarily vegetal*, with adjuncts disclosed.

Anything **not of vegetal origin** fails the test immediately.

## 3. Why Sodium Chloride Cannot Be Vegan

Sodium chloride (NaCl) fails on first principles:

- It is **mined, inorganic, crystalline** — not a product of plant life.
- It does **not** build living tissue; it **irritates**, **desiccates**, and **hardens**.
- It fails both the **linguistic** test (not vegetal) and the **physiological** test (not nourishing).

## 4. Salt as a Protoplasmic Poison

### A. Vitalistic Warnings

Hilton Hotema, *Man’s Higher Consciousness* (1961), wrote:

- “**Earthy salts cause old age**.”
- **Table salt** is poison masquerading as food.
- Salt **hardens tissues**, **accelerates degeneration**, **shortens life**, and **dulls the senses**.
- Fruits, with little “earthy matter,” are marked as longevity foods.

### B. Modern Toxicology

**Human Trials**

- **DASH-Sodium (NEJM 2001):** Lower NaCl → stepwise blood pressure reduction.
- **TOHP I/II (BMJ 2007):** Long-term NaCl reduction → fewer cardiovascular events.
- **SSaSS (NEJM 2021):** Replacing part of NaCl with KCl in 600 villages → 14% fewer strokes, 13% fewer major cardiovascular events.

**Animal Models & Swap Studies**

- **Dahl salt-sensitive rats (1962):** High-NaCl diet → hypertension, renal injury, shortened lifespan.
- **Swap experiments:** NaCl causes pathology; bicarbonate/citrate do not.

**Mechanisms**

- **Cardiovascular:** volume expansion, arterial stiffening.
- **Renal:** glomerular strain, proteinuria.
- **Skeletal:** calcium loss, bone demineralization.

**Populations**

- **Yanomami tribe (Circulation 1975):** Negligible NaCl intake; lifelong low blood pressure; no hypertension.

## 5. Language That Closes the Loophole

Reclaiming *vegan* as **exclusively vegetal** makes the boundary self-enforcing:

- If it doesn’t **grow, sprout, photosynthesize**, it isn’t vegan.
- If it **desiccates, ossifies, embalms**, it isn’t food.
- Salt, by any name, fails both tests.

**Operational rule:** *“No salt should ever be used on anything.”*

## 6. Vegan, Defined for the Present Age

- **Vegan (diet):** Exclusively vegetal origin. No mineral adjuncts, no mined inputs.
- **Vegetarian (diet):** Primarily vegetal, with disclosed mineral or animal adjuncts.

This return to natural meaning protects both **language** and **life**.

## 7. Conclusion

Words evolve toward truth. As *icon*, *energy*, and *vibe* sank back into their roots, *vegan* ripens into its natural sense: **exclusively vegetal** — which, by definition and by physiology, excludes sodium chloride, an **inorganic protoplasmic poison** masquerading as food.

**Salt embalms. Plants enliven. Vegan means choosing life.**
