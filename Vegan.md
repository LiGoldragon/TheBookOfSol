# Vegan, Reclaimed: Exclusively Vegetal — and Why Sodium Chloride Is Not Food

## TL;DR
- **Vegan (diet)** = composed **exclusively** of material obtained from **organic vegetation**.
- **Vegetarian (diet)** = **primarily** vegetal, with limited non-vegetal inputs.
- **Sodium chloride** (table salt) is an **inorganic mineral**—not vegetal, not food, and therefore **not vegan**.

## Define the words so they protect the body
- **Vegan (diet):** exclusively vegetal origin—plant tissues or plant cell cultures (if fungi/algae are included for labeling simplicity, declare it once).
- **Vegetarian (diet):** mainly vegetal origin, allowing non-vegetal adjuncts (e.g., minerals) with disclosure.

If an ingredient is **mined** or **manufactured as an inorganic**, it fails the vegan test on sight. If it does not build living tissue—if it **irritates, desiccates, ossifies**—it is not food.

> “Common table salt is a compound of sodium and chloride, **a mineral in inorganic form that cannot be used by the animal body. It enters the body as salt and leaves it as salt**.”

> “**Salt is a deadly irritant** to all the tissues of the body. Put some salt in your eye and feel the distressing effect.”

> “**No salt should ever be used on anything.**”

## What salt does in the system (and what one can verify in practice)
This conclusion is not reached by theory alone. **Drop inorganic salts** and clarity returns; **reintroduction** brings back bloat, thirst, and tension—repeatably observed on ordinary bodies.

Hotema’s notes align with those observations:

- **Irritation → mucus → catarrh:** salt irritates membranes; cells excrete mucus; catarrh develops.
- **Thirst & water-logging:** irritation makes cells call for water → abnormal thirst and a water-logged body.
- **Hardening & pressure:** with years of salt irritation, **cells/tissues harden**, **vessels harden**, **blood pressure rises**; kidneys are provoked.
- **Taste deadening:** salt and condiments dull taste buds; “flat” is learned damage, not truth.
- **Early degeneration case:** a child with salt-craving showed wrinkling and **arterial hardening** at age **four**.
- **“Social poison” diagnosis:** “**Salt is one of the worst of social poisons… It atrophies, dries up or hardens the tissues**…”
- **Living embalming:** “Today we **mummify the living** with… mineral oils, spices and salt.”
- **Animal data:** even small quantities fed to animals lead to death, with **uric-acid concretions** in liver/kidneys.

When a substance **desiccates, irritates, hardens, and deadens**, it is not food. It belongs with **poisons**—the same neighborhood as arsenic or sulfuric acid: materials a living body can survive for a time rather than thrive on.

> “With **acrid, biting and burning flavors**, such substances **belong to the poison class and are not fit to eat**.”

## Hidden in plain sight—because it pays
The canonization of a **rock** as “necessary” follows a familiar pattern: brand an **inorganic stimulant** as healthful, train the palate, profit, defend the habit.

Hotema sketches the template through the water trade:

> “Suffering people are often deceived by certain claims for **‘mineral water’**… Such water is **very hard and very bad** for the body. Those who recommend it for health are in error, **or they profit on the sale of it**… The **second effect**… is **mineral deposits in the body**… the remedy back-fires and does more harm than good.”

Salt in the modern pantry rhymes exactly with this pattern.

## Language that closes the loophole
To keep labels honest and bodies safer:

- **Vegan:** **exclusively vegetal**. No **mineral inputs** (e.g., sodium chloride) as ingredients. If it’s mined, it isn’t vegan.
- **Vegetarian:** **primarily vegetal** (≈90–95% by mass/energy), allowing inorganic adjuncts **with disclosure**.
- **Salted items:** **not vegan**; in truth, **not food**—tolerated **poisons** dressed as condiments.

The operational rule for kitchens and labels fits on one line:

> **“No salt should ever be used on anything.”**

## Experience seals it
A simple trial demonstrates the point: **restrict intake to organic vegetation and plant waters**; **exclude inorganic salts/condiments/fortificants**. Within days, thirst normalizes; within weeks, tension drains; within months, pressures and pulses steady. Reintroduction of sodium chloride—artisan or generic—reliably restores **irritation, bloat, and dulling**. Older writers mapped the terrain long ago; ordinary bodies corroborate it in practice. The language should catch up.
