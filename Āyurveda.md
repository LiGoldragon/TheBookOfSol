# **Āhāraḥ Prāṇānām Ādhāraḥ**

## That which supports life is the support of prāṇa

Āyurveda begins by dissolving its own authority. The *Caraka Saṃhitā* defines
Āyurveda as discernment grounded in lived effects, not as obedience to a canon.
From its first principles, truth is not inherited from the past; it is verified
in the present.

> **hitāhitaṁ sukhaṁ duḥkhaṁ\
> āyuṣyaṁ cānāyuṣyam eva ca\
> mānaṁ ca tac ca yatroktaṁ\
> āyurvedaḥ sa ucyate**\
> — *Caraka Saṃhitā*, Sūtrasthāna 1.41
>
> “That which explains what is beneficial and harmful,\
> what brings happiness and suffering,\
> what sustains life and what destroys it,\
> and the measure of life—\
> that is called Āyurveda.”

This definition quietly releases all authority from texts, including itself. It
grants authority to seeing. That is the clue. A science of life must converge,
through experience, on what life actually uses, renews, and circulates. When
observation is allowed to complete itself, the center is unavoidable: plasma,
and the intelligent recycling of plasma.

Across registers, the same reality is named by depth and refinement. Śivāmbu
names the living plasma of the body. Mūtra names its physiological expression.
Amṛta names its imperishable, elevated state when life is ordered and conscious.
In yoga, the deliberate reintroduction of this refined substance is known as
Amarolī. These are not competing ideas. They are a single continuum seen from
medicine, yoga, and metaphysics.

The Vedas speak of this center as Amṛta—not as an imported elixir, but as an
inherent essence.

> **amṛtasya nāma yad brahma**
>
> “That which is called Amṛta is Brahman.”

> **amṛtaṁ vai prāṇāḥ**\
> — *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad*
>
> “Prāṇa itself is Amṛta.”

Prāṇa does not exist apart from substance. Where prāṇa is sustained, Amṛta is
present.

The *Bhagavad Gītā* frames the same truth as law.

> **na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin\
> nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ**\
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 2.20
>
> “It is never born, nor does it die at any time.\
> Having been, it never ceases to be.”

> **brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham\
> amṛtasyāvyayasya ca**\
> — *Bhagavad Gītā* 14.27
>
> “I am the foundation of Brahman,\
> of the deathless and imperishable Amṛta.”

That which does not perish cannot depend on continual loss. It must be
conserved, circulated, and re-entered into life.

Here the historical pattern matters. Texts like the *Caraka Saṃhitā* did not
pass through gentle centuries. Scribes worked under threat in tyrannical periods
where certain forms of autonomy could not be transmitted openly. What could be
tolerated remained explicit; what threatened control was reduced, softened, or
left as implication. This is why the medical corpus preserves principles and
warnings, while yogic lineages preserve acts. What could not be stated plainly
in medicine migrated to yoga. What could not be written at length was compressed
into memory-sized texts.

The *Caraka Saṃhitā* leaves the clues intact. It warns repeatedly against
excessive loss, including loss through mūtra.

> **atiyoge kṣayo doṣāṇāṁ\
> balahānir bhavaty ati**
>
> “Through excess in function, depletion of the doṣas occurs,\
> and great loss of strength follows.”

> **mūtrasya atipravṛttau\
> balakṣayaḥ**
>
> “With excessive flow of mūtra,\
> strength is diminished.”

These are not moral cautions. They are mechanics. Life weakens when its refined
substances are discarded without discernment.

Where the medical voice grew constrained, yoga remained direct. The *Haṭha Yoga
Pradīpikā* names the closing of the circuit without apology.

> **amarolīṁ pibed yogī\
> vajrolīṁ ca samācaret**\
> — *Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā* 3
>
> “The yogī should drink Amarolī\
> and practice Vajrolī.”

Amarolī is the act of reintroduction. Vajrolī governs regulation. Together they
complete the circuit that medicine could only imply.

> **vajrolī siddhim āpnoti\
> sarvarogavivarjitaḥ**
>
> “Through Vajrolī, perfection is attained,\
> free from all disease.”

The *Ḍamar Tantra*—brief, memorizable, and therefore survivable—states the law
with uncompromising clarity.

> **yad dehāt jāyate dravyaṁ\
> tad dehaṁ pālayet punaḥ**
>
> “That which is born of the body\
> preserves the body again.”

> **svadehaṁ nāvalambeta\
> sa mṛtyuṁ samavāpnuyāt**
>
> “One who does not rely on the body itself\
> moves toward death.”

Even where human practice became constrained, the principle was left visible
through the cow.

> **gomūtraṁ pavitraṁ balyaṁ rasāyanam**
>
> “Cow mūtra is purifying, strengthening, and rejuvenative.”

This was not folklore. It was a permitted witness to an internal law.

Two currents were always known. The lunar current nourishes and stabilizes,
expressed most clearly through ghṛta. The solar current restores and renews,
expressed through the refined plasma of the living being, elevated as Amṛta and
deliberately reintroduced through yogic discipline. The axis of life is solar.

What distinguishes the present moment is convergence. Texts align. Lineages
recognize one another. Experience confirms what philosophy implied and yoga
preserved. The same center appears again and again, without persuasion.

The opening definition of Āyurveda told the reader everything in advance: no
text is final, no authority is inherited, and no practice is true unless it
sustains life. This is how the clue was left. This is how energetic seeing is
authorized. When observation is allowed to complete itself, plasma recycling
does not appear as a proposal. It reveals itself as necessary.

Āyurveda did not ask to be believed.\
It asked to be seen.
